# Angular-Aplicacion-heroes

This is my first application in Angular. This app is about heroes and each one of them are stored in the root of the app. I used bootstrap for the app design.

In the home page, you can see all heroes or read about this page.

In the Heroes page, you can see every heroe as a card design.

If you choice a heroe, you can see the description about him. There is also a button that takes you back to heroes page. (The little bat means the heroe belongs to DC, if it is from Marvel then you see a little spider-man. I added it as a joke).

This app have the funcionality of searching heroes. For each letter you are writting it starts to search.

If you are searching for a heroe that doesn't exist then you will have the next screen.

If you want to run this app, first download the repository and then you need to install ANGULAR-CLI. Once you have ANGULAR-CLI, in the root of project, run the next command "ng serve -o".
